# movie_recommendation_system
This repository is a personal project. This python notebook is a basic and very simple movie recommendation system. 

This personal project is a movie recommendation system that uses jupyter lab and makes use of data science tools like pandas & sklearn on a dataset to recommend movies to users based on their choice.
I have used an existing movie_dataset.csv github file to implement this project.
